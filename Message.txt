"Create a sleek, modern, and responsive website for the UCalgary Racing Telemetry System. The site should have 5 main pages with sub-menus for functionality, real-time data visualization, and project details. Use a clean, intuitive layout with a focus on real-time telemetry data and interactive charts. Ensure the design is mobile-friendly and optimized for fast loading. Here's the structure:**

Home Page:

Title: "UCalgary Racing Telemetry System"
Sections: Project overview, mission statement, and a dynamic banner displaying real-time car stats (e.g., speed, battery voltage).
Call-to-action buttons for "View Telemetry" and "Contact Us."
Telemetry Dashboard:

Real-time data visualization using responsive, interactive charts (line charts, bar graphs, scatter plots, and heat maps).
Sub-menus:
Live Data: Displays live streaming telemetry stats (e.g., CAN Bus messages, sensor readings).
Historical Data: Select a date/time range to view historical telemetry logs with time-series plots.
Filters for specific sensors and customizable thresholds for alerts.
Performance Insights:

Dynamic comparisons of telemetry metrics over multiple runs (e.g., lap times, energy consumption).
Tools for trend analysis with adjustable parameters (e.g., RPM, battery health).
Exportable reports in PDF format.
Team & Project:

Sections: About the team, roles, and contributions.
Sub-menus:
Hardware/Firmware: Details about the ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and CAN Bus integration.
Data Processing: Explanation of database setup (PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB) and backend architecture.
Web Interface: Key features of the frontend, built with React.js.
Contact Us:

Interactive form for inquiries.
Embedded map showing UCalgary Racingâ€™s workshop location.
Links to social media handles (optional).
Additional Requirements:

Use a dark theme with vibrant accent colors (e.g., orange, blue) to match a racing aesthetic.
Integrate a secure login system for the dashboard, allowing restricted access for team members and sponsors.
Enable chart interaction (zoom, pan, hover to display data points).
Include a "System Status" widget on the dashboard page for high-level performance indicators.
Ensure the site supports multiple users accessing real-time data simultaneously.
Add a footer with links to pages, a copyright notice, and sponsor logos.
